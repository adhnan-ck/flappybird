    title: 'The Rise and Fall: The History of Flappy Bird',
    excerpt: `
Flappy Bird was more than just a mobile game; it was a global phenomenon that captured the world’s attention almost overnight. Simple yet addictive, this pixelated masterpiece has a fascinating history filled with meteoric success, controversy, and an enigmatic creator.

The Creation of Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird was developed by Vietnamese indie game developer Dong Nguyen under his studio, .GEARS. Released in May 2013 on iOS, the game didn’t gain much attention initially. Its retro design, inspired by the pixelated visuals of 8-bit games like Super Mario, combined with a deceptively simple mechanic, made it unique in an era dominated by visually complex mobile games.

The premise was simple: players controlled a bird by tapping the screen, guiding it through gaps between green pipes. Despite its simplicity, Flappy Bird’s gameplay was brutally challenging, making it both frustrating and addictive.

The Meteoric Rise
Although the game was released in 2013, it wasn’t until early 2014 that Flappy Bird skyrocketed to fame. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook became flooded with screenshots of high scores, memes, and rants about the game's difficulty. The rage-inducing gameplay was oddly compelling, turning Flappy Bird into a viral sensation.

By January 2014, Flappy Bird topped the app charts in over 100 countries, and Dong Nguyen revealed that the game was generating $50,000 a day from ad revenue.

The Controversy
With great fame came criticism. Some accused the game of being overly derivative, pointing out the similarities between the green pipes in Flappy Bird and the iconic pipes from Nintendo's Super Mario series. Others argued that its addictive nature could lead to frustration and wasted time.

The game's extreme popularity also subjected Nguyen to intense public scrutiny. Bombarded with messages, both positive and negative, the developer expressed feelings of guilt over how the game was impacting players' lives.

The Sudden Removal
In February 2014, just as the game had reached its peak, Nguyen made the shocking decision to remove Flappy Bird from app stores. He announced on Twitter:

"I am sorry, Flappy Bird users, 22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down. I cannot take this anymore."

The move sparked outrage and confusion, with many speculating about the reasons behind his decision. Some believed it was due to legal pressure from Nintendo, while others thought it was an emotional response to the overwhelming attention. Nguyen later clarified that he removed the game because it had become an unhealthy obsession for many players.

The Legacy of Flappy Bird
Even after its removal, Flappy Bird left a lasting impact on the gaming industry. Phones with the game installed were listed on eBay for thousands of dollars, and countless clones and spin-offs flooded app stores in the wake of its disappearance.

The game’s simplistic design and challenging mechanics also inspired a new wave of indie developers to create minimalist, highly addictive games. Today, Flappy Bird remains a cultural touchstone, a reminder of how a simple idea, executed well, can captivate the world.

Lessons from Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird's story is a fascinating case study in virality, the pressures of fame, and the unexpected consequences of success. It demonstrates how the simplest concepts can resonate deeply with players and reminds us that success doesn’t always bring happiness.

Although Dong Nguyen has since released other games, none have matched the explosive success of Flappy Bird. Still, his creation remains etched in gaming history as a phenomenon that took the world by storm—and then disappeared just as quickly.

    title: 'Why I wrote a blog here which is kinda weird.',
    excerpt: `Its because adding text and amount of contents which is related to the game can increase the chance of getting my page in the top of google search. Thats why. so please pardon me if its looking bad.
    The reason i made the game is because there is only one flappybird game available online which have leaderboards and kinda stuff but its filled with ads and it has became unplayable so i made this adfree for now(may be in the future i might add some ads. who knows). flappybird.com is already registered so i couldnt buy that domain. so play flappy bird online and have fun . compete with players all around the world.
